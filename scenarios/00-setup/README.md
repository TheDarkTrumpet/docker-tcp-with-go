# Introduction

This section contains information about getting started with this tutorial.

# Obtaining the VM Image

The VM image itself is located in the `images` directory.  Documentation for using the image is also there. You can also install Docker on your host machine as well, if desired.  This depends on your operating system to the method of install.  The main `README` in the base of this folder provides more details on what to search for.

# Obtaining the Docker Files

Once you have a machine, that's capable of running Docker, loaded, you can obtain the images by running `get-images.sh` in this folder, or `get-images.sh` in the image folder.  Both are virtually identical.
